                    In the wake of such one-hit wonders as A Taste Of Honey, Debby Boone, and the Starland Vocal Band,
                    and a year before Christopher Cross, Rickie Lee Jones won the Grammy award for Best New Artist. But
                    as anyone will tell you, an artist puts a lifetime into a first album, and suddenly has to start
                    from scratch for the second. Luckily for her, Warner Bros. was the kind of label that was focused on
                    building catalogs, and was happy to wait until she was ready for her follow-up.

                    Despite having been a big shot on the scene for several years, it wasn’t until he took a
                    job touring with Delaney & Bonnie and Friends that Eric Clapton considered doing an album under his
                    own name. Most of the aforementioned Friends played on the sessions, including two guys who would
                    soon run off with Joe Cocker for the Mad Dogs & Englishmen tour before regrouping with Eric later
                    that year. Another key contributor was Leon Russell on piano, who would weave his way throughout
                    various projects of the time.
